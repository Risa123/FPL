#FPL programming language
For introduction first part of documentation.
1 ITRODUCTION
Name of this language is FPL(Function processing Language). Reason for this name is, than is was original meant as Lisp dialect. So the syntax can be diveded to lists and atoms. One of problems of lisp is a large amount of parathesises. This language has two types of lists. Block lists and statement lists. The block list is written inside of curly brackets. Statement lit is by new line.
Example:
{ <statement list>}
{
 <statement list>
 <statement list>
}
Arguments for compiler are <project directory><C compiler><output file>.
C compiler is actually command line command, so you can add arguments for it.
