0.1.0 snapshot 1
check for unreachable statements
code refactoring
methods can be declared
added realloc to std.backend
added class Random to std.math
access modifiers added not working yet
0.1.0 snapshot 2
access modifier private implemented at module and class level
modifier protected currently works as private because of no inheritance
private can be used in modules
pointers to types can now used its fields/methods unless to are also fields/methods of pointer
constructor added
module std.io added currently with no use
module std.system added
0.1.0 snapshot 3
fix fields not defined
fix error reporting
fix new method
expose std library and self-hosting compiler sources
add notepad++ syntax for FPL
0.1.0 snapshot 4
fix class function checks for name clashes
fix compiler not using cnames of types in function pointer
fix types used in declarations not imported with type using them
classes can be abstract
interfaces and virtual methods added but not yet implemented
parent constructor calling
0.1.0 snapshot 5
implemented interface
constructor may not have a block but just call to parent constructor
method asByte removed from char
cast can be used to cast char to integer number and vice-versa
cast can be used to cast interface back to non-primitive type
every class implementing an interface has methods to converting to given interface
example method name: asInterface
added keywords main and this to notepad++ syntax
compilers build system changed
added build-in main to declare main function
impossible to declare C main
impossible to make libraries will be reintroduced in 1.0

0.1.0 snapshot 7
fix abstract methods cannot be declared in abstract classes
fix default constructor code not append to constructor
fix classes can have fields of its type
fix non-abstract or native methods not requiring blocks causing possible errors
fix parent constructor called in implicit constructor
fix requires parent constructor if doesn't have implicit one
virtual and abstract methods implemented
bool operators &,&&,|,|| added
override added to notepad++ syntax
override implemented
conversion to interface and parent class is implicit
code refactoring
0.1.0 snapshot 8
fix return not processing expressions properly
fix virtual method
0.1.0 snapshot 9
fpointer added
try catch finally throw and fpointer is added to notepad++ syntax
added method alloc to all classes to allocate new instance
method new is now used to create non-dynamic instances
fix static methods clashing with instance methods
bitwise operators added

0.1.0 snapshot 10
cstruct function to declared c structure
throw removed from syntax it will be a method
std.lang is imported to every module
0.1.0 snapshot 11
fix cstruct not importable
fix module variable declarations not included
if_flag added
0.1.0 snapshot 12
module io separated into base and file submodules
internal access modifier added  fields declared to be internal can only be access from inside of module
